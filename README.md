## websockify-other: Alternative WebSocket implementations

This directory contain various implementations of
WebSockets-to-TCP-Socket proxies. These are not as complete as the
primary [Python](https://github.com/novnc/websockify) and
[JavaScript](https://github.com/novnc/websockify-js) projects, but should
still be usable.
